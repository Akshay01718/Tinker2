### Project Description
A hilarious, science-backed dog breed database that tells you whether your dog‚Äôs tail is likely to straighten or stay curled forever‚Äîbecause science, humor, and tail-wagging facts.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
For centuries, humans have wondered: "Can I straighten my dog's curly tail?" This burning question has kept philosophers awake at night and caused unnecessary existential crises worldwide. Clearly, we needed a website to scientifically validate what every grandmother already knew.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created an interactive web experience where users can select dog breeds and get precise mathematical probabilities for tail straightening success. Complete with genetic explanations, cultural proverbs in multiple languages, probability meters, and enough dog facts to win any trivia contest. Because if you're going to prove the obvious, might as well do it with style!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
-Languages used: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, Python (for data generation)
